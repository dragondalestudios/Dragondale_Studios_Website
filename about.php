<h1 class="about_h1">About us</h1>

<p class="About_us"> Why do we play videogames? Videogames let us experience things. They bring imagination to life, and allow us to engage the stories people share in an interactive environment unlike any other medium in history. 
</p>

<p class="About_us">We believe the most important element at the core of every great videogame is the story. As videogame makers, we have the privilege and honor of utilizing this infinitely imaginative space to share deep and thought provoking ideas and compelling stories to a vast and ever-expanding audience of people. We stand in the early days of a new genre of artistic expression that is still establishing its role in our culture, and we have a duty to make videogames that leave a lasting impression on the history of this medium. We do not take this honor lightly.</p>

<p class="About_us">Our goal at DragonDale Studios is to make games that give players and engrossing experience, compelling story and powerful message. Our games will range in scope from videogames that help people learn foreign languages to ultra deep rpgs, where every detail of the world is vividly brought to life, to games that mean to share a story, and an emotional adventure with the user. We will make games that we want to play, without focusing on profits, but rather, we will seek to craft works of art that we are passionate about, to an audience that will enjoy these games for the unique experience they will provide. Our culture will be one of team work and passion for good game design, where we will work together as equals to achieve our lofty design goals. We will publish our games online, and our production schedule will adhere to the quality of the product, not the other way around. Every game we produce at DragonDale Studios will proudly bear our name, and each one will seek to redefine the paradigms of their respective genres. No project will ship until it has reached and exceeded our vision for we are the elite team of DragonDale Studio Gamegeneers!</p>
